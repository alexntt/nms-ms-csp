A quick hack to invoke methods on Microsoft's Partner Center API.

Microsoft provides a .NET and (not officially maintained) Java SDK, but no
Python client (even though that they provide a Python SDK for Azure).

The API's login URLs include 'oauth' in their paths, but it does not seem an
actual OAuth2 handshake- the actual token obtention code seems simple enough
to reproduce from scratch.
